# SimulatedMapReduce

## What Is This

This repository provides a Maven project as a pre-assignment for Sakamoto's lectures about Hadoop (e.g. [BIGCHA](http://bigcha.net/) and TopSE).
The project includes a simulated Hadoop MapReduce framework working on a pure Java environment.
Note that this simulated framework has some differences from the official framework.

Please clone this repository and import it as a Maven project into Eclipse (or Intellij IDEA).
You should see the detailed instructions in the Excercise[1-6]Main classes.
